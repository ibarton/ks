                    <p>As demand for Kenson's services increased, a new company, Kenson Operational Services Limited (KOSL) was established in January 2000. By May 2000, PF Engineering & Construction Company Limited was formed and in 2014, Kenson acquired the Paper Company CWD Enterprises Limited as part of it's vision for growth and Diversity.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Kenson group of company's robust history has Thus creating the Kenson Group Of Companies which can boast of employing well over 350 employees.
                    </p>
